        <p className="info">
                As you will gather from my CV, I am a Certified AWS Solutions Architect and SysOps Administrator, with a strong background in IT and
                technical support, working to deliver high quality oversight, analytical and client engagement services to the best possible standards. I also have strong leadership and team working skills and am very well organised with a keen attention to detail, so I believe I would be an ideal candidate for this role.
                Having self taught to obtain my AWS Certifications (and I am planning to study for more), as well as completing a number of personal
                AWS based projects, my objective now is to pursue a career in a junior or trainee Cloud Computing role.
       
        <br />
        <br />
        
                I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills, combined with an ability to work equally well either as part of a
                collaborative team or autonomously when required; and I am obviously also highly IT literate with a good working knowledge of JavaScript,
                Node and React. If there are any questions or areas that you would like me to clarify, then please do not hesitate to get in contact and,
                of course, I would very much welcome the opportunity to expand on my background and discuss the role further with you in interview.
